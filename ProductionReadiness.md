# Production Readiness

Here’s my personal checklist for what I look for before calling this project production-ready. If you’re deploying, make sure you can check off everything below!

## Build & Test
- All projects build with no errors or warnings
- All unit and integration tests pass
- Code coverage is up to my standards

## Security & Configuration
- No secrets are ever hardcoded or in source control
- All secrets are managed via environment variables or a secure secrets manager
- `appsettings.Production.json` is used for production overrides (never for secrets)
- Authentication and authorization are enforced on all sensitive endpoints
- HTTPS is enforced in production
- CORS policy is locked down for production

## Observability & Monitoring
- Prometheus metrics endpoint is enabled and secured
- Grafana dashboards are configured and seeded
- Application logs are structured and sent to a log aggregator
- Alerts are set up for critical errors and performance issues

## Docker & Deployment
- Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are up to date and tested
- All services (API, DB, Redis, Prometheus, Grafana) run correctly in containers
- CI/CD pipeline is set up for automated build, test, and deployment

## Database & Data
- Database migrations are up to date and tested
- Backup and restore procedures are documented and tested
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit

## Documentation
- README.md and API docs are up to date
- All environment variables and configuration options are documented

## Performance & Scaling
- Load testing has been performed
- Application scales horizontally/vertically as needed
- Caching (Redis) is configured and tested

## Miscellaneous
- All unused code, files, and dependencies are removed
- License and legal notices are included if required
- Rollback plan is documented

**I always review this list before any production deployment.**
