# Contributing

Thanks for checking out my project and considering a contribution! I’m always happy to see pull requests, bug reports, and new ideas.

## How to Get Involved
1. **Fork this repo** and make a feature branch for your work.
2. **Write clear, well-documented code** (see my `DeveloperGuide.md` for style).
3. **Add or update tests** for anything you change.
4. **Run all tests locally** to make sure nothing breaks.
5. **Open a pull request** with a good description and link to any related issues.
6. **Join the code review**—I’ll give feedback and help you get it merged.

## Branching
- `main` is for production-ready code.
- Use `feature/xyz`, `bugfix/xyz`, or release branches as needed.

## Code Review
- I review all PRs and require at least one approval.
- Automated checks (build, test, lint) must pass before merging.

## Reporting Issues
- Please use GitHub Issues for bugs or feature requests.
- Include clear steps to reproduce and what you expected to happen.

## Community
- Be kind and constructive in all discussions.
- Please follow the project’s code of conduct.
