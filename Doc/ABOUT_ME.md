# About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m a graduate developer, and I built this project just for fun and to learn more about building production-grade systems. I love experimenting with new tech, clean architecture, and making things that (hopefully) help people get more done.

If you want to connect, collaborate, or just chat about code, feel free to reach out:
