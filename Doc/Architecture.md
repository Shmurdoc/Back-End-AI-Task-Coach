# AI Task Coach - Clean Architecture Documentation

## 1. Architecture Overview (Updated September 2025)

This project implements a comprehensive Clean Architecture pattern for an enterprise-grade AI Task Coach system with advanced gamification features.

### Core Architectural Layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Core business entities (User, TaskItem, Goal, Habit, Analytics), enums, and business rules
- **Application Layer**: CQRS patterns, comprehensive service layer with gamification, validators, DTOs, and business logic
- **Infrastructure Layer**: EF Core persistence, repositories, external services (notifications), dependency injection
- **WebAPI Layer**: REST API controllers, middleware, background services, SignalR hubs, Swagger documentation

## 2. Key Features Implemented

### Database Layer
- ✅ **EF Core Migrations**: Complete InitialCreate migration with 11 tables
- ✅ **Entity Relationships**: Users, Tasks, Goals, Habits, Analytics with proper foreign keys
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive constraints and validation rules

### Gamification System (New)
- ✅ **Points & Achievements**: Progressive point system with streak bonuses
- ✅ **Badge System**: 15+ badge types with rarity levels (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary)
- ✅ **Leaderboards**: Weekly and all-time competitive rankings
- ✅ **Challenge System**: Dynamic challenges with real-time progress tracking
- ✅ **Behavioral Analytics**: Relapse detection and critical mode activation
- ✅ **Motivational Messaging**: AI-powered adaptive encouragement

### Background Services
- ✅ **Critical Mode Worker**: Automated detection and intervention for user productivity issues
- ✅ **Procrastination Recovery**: Intelligent recovery mechanisms for task abandonment
- ✅ **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous user behavior analysis and response

## 3. Technology Stack & Infrastructuregned the Architecture

## 1. My Approach

I went with a layered clean architecture for this project because I wanted it to be easy to maintain, test, and extend. Here’s how I broke it down:

- **Domain Layer**: This is where all the core business logic lives—entities like Habit, Goal, TaskItem, User, plus enums and analytics.
- **Application Layer**: Handles CQRS (using MediatR), service interfaces, validators, and business rules.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Deals with persistence (EF Core), repositories, external services (MailKit, Twilio), Redis caching, and logging.
- **WebAPI Layer**: Exposes everything via REST controllers, sets up DI, middleware (metrics, error handling), Swagger docs, and SignalR for real-time stuff.

## 2. Supporting Tech
- **Backend**: .NET 8.0, EF Core, SQL Server
- **Gamification**: Custom enterprise-grade system with real business logic
- **Observability**: Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards
- **Testing**: Unit/integration tests with comprehensive coverage
- **Deployment**: Docker, docker-compose, production-ready configuration
- **Background Processing**: Hosted services for continuous monitoring

## 4. Design Decisions & Rationale

### Clean Architecture Benefits
- **CQRS & MediatR**: Separation of commands and queries for scalability
- **Dependency Inversion**: Easy testing and component swapping
- **Single Responsibility**: Each layer has a clear, focused purpose
- **Extensibility**: New features can be added without affecting existing code

### Gamification Architecture
- **Service Layer Pattern**: `GamificationService` provides centralized business logic
- **DTO Pattern**: Strongly-typed data transfer objects for all gamification features
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction for badges, achievements, challenges
- **Observer Pattern**: Background services monitor user behavior for real-time responses

### Security & Production Readiness
- **Environment-based Configuration**: Secrets handled via appsettings and environment variables
- **Validation Layer**: Comprehensive input validation using FluentValidation
- **Error Handling**: Global exception middleware with proper logging
- **Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and health checks
