# Security Policy

I take security seriously in this project. If you spot a vulnerability, please let me know privately so I can fix it before it’s public.

## How to Report a Security Issue
- Email me directly or open a private GitHub issue (don’t post it publicly until I’ve had a chance to patch it).

## What I Support
- Only the latest release gets security updates.

## My Security Best Practices
- I never commit secrets or sensitive data to source control.
- All credentials are managed with environment variables or a secure secrets manager.
- See `ProductionReadiness.md` for my secure deployment checklist.
