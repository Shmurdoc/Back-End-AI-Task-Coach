# SDLC Status: Back-End AI Task Coach

Here’s where I am in the software development life cycle for this project. I update this as I go, so you always know what’s done and what’s next.

## Current Phase
- **Testing & Pre-Production**

## What’s Done
- Requirements and design docs are finished
- Core architecture and infrastructure are in place
- Habit tracking, notifications, and observability are working
- CI/CD, Docker, and deployment pipeline are set up
- Security and config best practices are followed
- Most documentation and onboarding guides are ready

## What I’m Working On
- Fixing the last few test failures
- Finalizing task/goal management logic
- Expanding test coverage for edge cases

## What’s Next
- Add authentication/authorization (JWT/OAuth2)
- Integrate AI/ML for smarter coaching
- Add production-grade secret management
- Prep for full production deployment

## How I Work
- I use Agile: short sprints, regular reviews
- CI/CD for fast feedback and deployment
- Docs and code reviews are part of every phase

**I’ll keep this updated as the project moves through the SDLC.**
